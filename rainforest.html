  <p class="info-text">
    The Amazon rainforest, is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the Amazon biome that covers most of the Amazon basin of South America. The majority of the forest is contained within Brazil, with 60% of the rainforest, followed by Peru with 13%, Colombia with 10%, and with minor amounts in Bolivia, Ecuador, French Guiana, Guyana, Suriname, and Venezuela. Four nations have "Amazonas" as the name of one of their first-level administrative regions, and France uses the name "Guiana Amazonian Park" for its rainforest protected area. The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining rainforests, and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species including many species of myrtle, laurel, palm, and acacia, as well as rosewood, Brazil nut, and rubber tree..
    More than 30 million people of 350 different ethnic groups live in the Amazon, which are subdivided into 9 different national political systems and 3,344 formally acknowledged indigenous territories. Indigenous peoples make up 9% of the total population with 60 of the groups remaining largely isolated.

    The AWA are a tribe living in the rainforest, and as a result of deforestation and logging, their home is being destroyed. The AWA depend on the rainforest for food medicine and resources. Loggers also introduce disease that these people have never encountered before and have no immunity to. As a result a traditional, peaceful people are constantly having to relocate to avoid being wiped out by illegal loggers.

    Deforestation is also a massive problem, cutting down trees removes the ability for the carbon dioxide to be removed from the atmosphere, causing global warming. In the 20th century, Brazil’s rapidly growing population settled major areas of the Amazon Rainforest. The size of the Amazon forest shrank dramatically as a result of settlers’ clearance of the land to obtain lumber and to create grazing pastures and farmland. The trees were not all cut down and burning was a preferred method of deforestation as it was cheaper, not requiring expensive machinery, as a result of the burning even more greenhouse gases were produced. Brazil holds approximately 60 percent of the Amazon basin within its borders, and some 1,583,000 square miles (4,100,000 square km) of this was covered by forests in 1970. The amount of forest cover declined to some 1,283,000 square miles (3,323,000 square km) by 2016, about 81 percent of the area that had been covered by forests in 1970.

    In the 1990s the Brazilian government and various international bodies began efforts to protect parts of the forest from human encroachment, exploitation, deforestation, and other forms of destruction. This worked and brought the deforestation rate down dramatically, however the past 10 years clearly show that the efforts are failing and deforestation is on the rise. The upward trend in deforestation has been catalysed by a series of environmental setbacks that started with controversial changes in the Brazilian Forest Code in 2012, and have been intensified by recent weakening of the Ministry of the Environment’s deforestation enforcement actions, disregard of related climate change policies, and law bills that may regularize illegally grabbed public lands.

    So how can we save the rainforest?
  </p>
  <p class="info-text">
    On the international level, organisations and countries have expressed their concerns with the climbing deforestation and actions that worked in the past need to be resumed. Brazil must hold the people, that were working against Brazil's environmental and social actions, accountable.

    On the smaller scale you as a person can help by reducing consumption of goods made at the cost of the amazon such as paper and furniture. You can buy responsibly sourced products. Finally, reduce your carbon footprint and waste.
